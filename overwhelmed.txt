1. Change from saying 'ship1' to it just being blue

2. When the blue is clicked it turns red
2b) background is changed from white to gray

3. When the gray is clicked it turns white

4. Each of the divs gets a dataset value that can be correlated to the board it is displaying

5. Implement the logic for when a div is clicked its dataset is read and the board recieves an attack based off that

6. Get rid of the safety net of the blue 

7. Get logic for if the attack is a hit the corresponding cell is turned red 

8. Get logic for if the attack is a miss the corresponding cell is turned white

9. Apply that same logic to a random computer move (can be called from console or j once in the code to test)

10. Reintroduce the game loop using the new functions that have been written 

11. Investigate drag and drop for the ships rather than them being the same every time

12. Work on CPU intelligence -- implement logic for attackign adjacent squares (could make  a next moves array
and if its not empty run one of those)

THATS ALL YOU NEED FOR THE MINIMUM 
1,2,3,4,6,9,10 are all easy

5,7,8,11,12 could be hard but we have blown through every notion of that throughout this project


13. Make it look nice
